# USFDA 483 Observation Analysis and Categorization
The project aimed to automate the analysis of USFDA Form 483 inspection reports issued to pharmaceutical companies. These reports highlight compliance issues related to safety and quality standards. The goal was to simplify and accelerate the review process through automation, text summarization, and machine learning techniques.

# Key Objectives:

* Automate the extraction and processing of Form 483 data.
* Summarize lengthy inspection reports to focus on critical issues.
* Categorize and cluster the reports using machine learning for better insights.

# Methodology

* Data Extraction: Automated the retrieval and cleaning of inspection data using PyPDF for text extraction.
* Text Summarization: Used the BART model (a neural network) to summarize long inspection reports into concise points.
* Clustering: Applied the K-Means algorithm to categorize reports based on similar issues (e.g., contamination, equipment failure).
* Insights: Provided a centralized view of recurring compliance issues for easier decision-making.

# Results:

* Reduced manual effort and time in reviewing inspection reports.
* Provided actionable insights for improving compliance and regulatory standards.
