The mr stir that collected the samples was a fixed term employee not qualified to collect l samples enter the production area or make records . The signed smiling records indicated a second employee had been the simpler even though that employee confused that they had not collected any samples and had instructed the fixed term employee to collect the samples without smiling from each point . These analytical records contained smiling stain and end times that did not con late to actual activities .

QUALITY UNIT ,The responsibilities and procedures applicable to the quality control unit are not in writing and fully followed . Specific ll A There is a lack of Quality Knit oversight on the issuance handling retrieved and reconciliation of documents that are used in the manufacture ing of drug products at your site . His lack of oversight violates the film s of 018075 for form issuance . For example 1 Controlled documents related to the following department to can be printed from the Electronic Document Management System without any oversight of the Quality Knit . These documents are used to record original information . For example but not limited to of forms such as room 060789 Request room for He process sing room 039593 Dissolution analysis room 011918 Auto simpler variation record for model room 034262 room 011907 U .

In addition the Quality Knit has given an access to employees across the site to all documents on which allows employees of other departments to print controlled documents unrelated to their respective departure it . 2 During the inspection I observed the Quality Knit of your nm allowed destruction of original documents such as balance weight count rolled forms formats . For example In 04 Dec 2023 I observed a balance pertaining to Balance of of 545 Hated Aimed 01 Dec 2023 b ll Eight 8 . 007 g that was disposed inside your nm s main . The Production Technician that disposed this stated the practice of disposing the balance is normal by all employees in his department in the event printing and weighing nor . The nm only began recording the justification and type of document that was placed into the disposal bind less than one month ago on 06 Sov 2023 . However reconciliation of the documents disposed of on 11 Sov 2023 as noted in the revealed the number of pages disposed inside the bin were less than the total number pages the count rolled forms . For example the entry made in the dated 11 Sov 2023 for the disposal of Leaning room 59 and room 60 were t user two separate entries pertaining to nine 9 pages finns . However the number of pages received for disposal were eight 8 for room 59 and two 2 for room 60 . Your Quality Knit provided no justification for the missing one 1 page for room 59 and six 6 pages for room 60 . The total of eight 8 pages remained missing for which your for conducted no investigation to ensure the missing pages does not get missed in the lack of Quality Knit s oversight on the issuance retrieved and reconciliation of documents . B Your of laboratory has no equipment usage or any other document that records incubation usage details for a total l b across various temperature ranges that are used to inculpate and environment monitoring plates . The lack of an issued violates your To . Killed Issuance Handling and of Wounded Took Version To . 8 . 0 Section 5 . 0 and To . Killed Instrument usage log Version To . 3 . 0 Section 5 . 0 . Is a result of no equipment usage or documentation for the there is no assurance over its usage breakdown if any and whether celebrations were performed on time . Her the above reference procedures the Quality Knit of the for is required to verify anti is b for usage and accuracy of data entered . However given the lack of this purification is not happening and there was no justification provided by your management about not conducting these activities . ,Procedures describing the handling of written and oral complaints related to drug products are efficiently written or followed . Specifically your Quality Knit has failed to investigate Product Quality Complaints thoroughly . For example t user Of .

B . Your nm has not throw . they in count amiability market complaints for lb ill tt 4 Tablets i my and tt 4 drug products . In 11 Dec 2023 I observed your nm received mainly between 7 to 22 come acts each month since year 2019 to 01 Dec 2023 for count amiability complaints . The evaluation of random selected twelve 12 for the period of year 2021 to 01 Dec that the complaints were closed based on the similar investigation t user summary root cause and CAPAs simply by writing these sections or copy and passing upon changing the batch information . Your nm took no meaningful efforts to determine the root cause and establish CAP Is to overcome the count amiability . C .

Over the last two years none of the black particles identified d during visual inspection on the and lines have been further identified . 4 . of of 2300482 Product Injection my Watch Number Result Individual unknown impurity at of Limit Final classification Invalid Late Investigation Begged 10 An 2022 Late Investigation Closed 23 Web 2022 Foot cause sanctioning of the In January 10 2022 your of laboratory obtained failing result for individual unknown impurity at of which you confirmed through hypothesis test on the original of EQP of 418 and ruled out any issue with instrument analyst and retention times theoretical plates and tailing factor . Your of laboratory changed systems without any scientific justification to repeat the analysis using freshly prepared mobile phase standard and sample test solutions . Your firm attempted to co complete repeat analysis on different systems for multiple days however the repeat an analysis was adopted at the system suitability stage due to incidents as mentioned below of EQP of 304 Hated analysis initiated 25 An 2022 Incident peak not elated missing in standard of EQP of 308 Hated analysis initiated 31 An 2022 Incident Improper peak shape of peak In the above two 2 cases your firm deviated from Document To . of 002 Revision C Killed Handling of Laboratory Incidence . Your firm did not log the incident to investigate the issues pertaining to missing peak and for improper peak shape of peak . The overall assessment of longed for the of market in years 2021 and 2022 revealed three 3 out of fifty two 52 having laboratory incidents during investigation . However your firm did not log a separate to investing ate the root cause . Furthermore in the same period of years 2021 and 2022 your firm changed the instrument in seven 7 investigations without any scientific ion and the original failing results through repeat analysis . 5 . To further actions are initiated when there are repeated Laboratory Incidence Reports s that identify the same root cause unless there are associated with the same analyst in a For example there were 10 s in 2022 that id ratified pitting errors during BET analysis but no further action was identified in the investigations . Additionally in communications with the in October 2022 your site stated there were To due to Petting error post implementation of An 2022 as it related to a review of BET testing . His response did not consider the continuing s that were opened f or pitting errors during BET testing . The response to the also provided a graph demonstrating increasing BET investigations with the statement the site has implements significant related to BET testing by . Is a result the site has consistently reduced the number of BET results for the method from 66 in 2017 to two through October 2022 and none since April 2022 . However since November 2020 investigations that we re previously classified as were instead identified as . The data from 2021 and 2022 was not considered in this trend analysis . 6 . In October 25 2022 communicated to your firm that the identified root cause for investigations 2345266 and 2349143 for BET were not based . The investigations have not been further evacuated since that time . 7 . Since July of 2022 there have been 16 opened for cracked dedicated media observed at the end of sample collection or during plate reading . A comprehensive investigation of media handling at this site was not conducted . In investigation provided by the media supplier on December 1 2022 identified that the root cause may be due to the type of used and that the supplier would switch to providing an with a low To action was taken for the existing supplies of still in invent or prior to this change by the supplier . ,Equipment and utensils are not cleaned and maintained at appropriate intervals to prevent contamination that would alter the safety identity strength quality or purity of the drug product . 1 .

Operators reported they wipe with and do the cleaning inside of the filling room . There is no cleaning purification to ensue re this process is ad quite and on January 26 2023 cleaned change pa its were observed entrusted in places with unknown black and color materials . 3 . Joint 1 of your line clearance states Check all th e change part for correct format size and ensure no damage . Your production operators select Not damaged option even though change parts were found damaged when inspected on January 26 2023 . ,Equipment used in the manufacture processing packing or holding of drug products is not of appropriate design to facilitate operations for its intended use and cleaning and maintenance . 1 . The filling rooms and tapping rooms for both the and filling lines used for of market product are not designed to permit operator s to move freely to the required areas . Manufacturing operators are required to go underneath the line to get back and forth to the different sides of the machine to perform rout in intervention during filling such as adding stopped to the stopped bowl . 2 . After vital washing on the line vilas move via conveyed to the The barrier installed to protect the vilas as they move on the conveyed has gaps exposing the vilas to the Trade D environment after vital washing . 3 . The filling line is not designed to permit viewing from windows or camera from outside of the aseptic owning areas . Entry rico rd show of is not providing routine oversight during filling operations . 4 . There is a drain line below the filling state on on the line to capture spilled product or product from broken vilas . His drain line has not been designed to facilitate cleaning . ,Your firm failed to establish adequate written or procedures for production and process controls designed to assure that the drug products have the identity strength purity and quality that they are supported or represented to possess . 1 . During the manual visual inspection of my batch and my batch on January 20 2023 as well as visual inspection of my batch and my batch on January 23 2023 there were visual inspector that did not follow procedure Of 064 Manual Visual Inspection of Killed Products . These visual inspector did not inspect against for a minimum of 2 . Review of completed visual inspection records found Of P of 064 Manual Visual Inspection of Killed Products could not have been followed because more units were inspected in the document time periods than would have been reasonably possible if the procedure had been followed . a . In September 23 2022 during visual inspection of batch the inspector averaged an overall speed of per bag . The procedure requires at least to inspect the at least to inspect on Additionally time is needed to pick up and put down bags and physically remove and categories defective bags . b . In December 10 2022 during manual visual inspection of of Injection my my my the inspector averaged per vilas . For inspection of vilas the procedure first requires inspection of the caps and batch printed data a step observed to take when viewed on January 23 2023 . His is followed by a minimum inspection time of Additionally time is needed to pick up or put down vilas physically place defects into bind or move the inspected outside of the visual inspection room . 3 . There is a lack of scientific rational for limit acting vilas containing particles of known sizes from the kits used to qualify the manual visual inspector . is used in the manufacturing area and there was apparent wear on observed directly above open vilas on the filling line . During the initial qualification of the defect kit defects were detected at a lower rate than other particle types . 4 . There is a lack of scientific rational for stab wishing the acceptance criterion for manual visual inspector of not less than by combining type A defects including particulars and type B defects including empty vilas and wrong color . Further change control 2531727 has approved changing the acceptance criterion for vilas with particulars to at least without a scientific rational for how this limit was chosen . The ranging study for the known particle defects showed a probability of detection at or above for all particles down to m for glass particles stopped particles fibres and hairs . The manual inspector qualification test kits contain these types of defects at m of greater size . 5 . The acceptance criterion for light intensity during visual inspection was changed from to not less than klux for all products on Act ober 5 2019 but lacked a rational for why the change was made . His limit applies to vilas in clear vilas and amber vilas inspected for the of market . There was no evaluation of whether amber vi as require higher light intensity or whether the clear vilas should have an upper limit . In January 23 2023 measurement in the visual inspection area for EQP 443 showed variation within the area . Tooth had a reading of klux taken at the while booth had a reading of klux taken from the In that day my batch was being usually inspected which is a clear liquid inside of a clear vital . Amber vilas are also usually in specter using the same visual inspection booths . ,Procedures designed to prevent contamination of drug products supporting to be sterile are not established . 1 . For Injection my my my the bulk sample is collected from the manufacturing tank . The product is subsequently transferred to the holding tank through a There is no established hold time limit the product can remain in the holding tank before is started . For example during batch the time between smiling and the end of was approximately 11 hour ere is no smiling data from the holding tank . The product is transferred through a prior to filling and the is tested using filled vilas . 2 . In operator working in the filling room of the line on January 19 2023 during the filling of batch was obs served with exposed skin on their forehead . ,Procedures for the preparation of master production and control records are not followed . Your Quality Knit lacks adequate oversight on th e control and management of documents . For example 1 . In 19 An 2023 we found torn pieces of analytical l balance weight in a transparent plastic scrap bag located inside your of Laboratory . The torn pieces were pertaining to Balance of EQP of 503 balance dated 18 An 2023 and belonged to test sample of my my Watch Number West Essay and Eight my . Your of Analyst stated the weight was destroyed due to the sample preparation issue . Your of Analyst deviated from the following procedures due to destruction of balance Original Saw Data x Document To . of CQA 002 Killed Document Control Revision L Effective date 09 Rep 2022 Section 5 . 3 . 2 Document Destruction Process x Document Number of CQA 003 Killed Good Documentation Practices Revision E Effective date 05 An 2023 x Document Number 04 04 Killed Data Integrity Revision C Effective date 29 But 2021 Furthermore the sample weighing and analytical balance destruction activities occurred during the that has no Supervisors oversight . 2 . In 19 An 2023 we observed your production un t employees destroyed documents signed under One By section by tearing into i eyes . These torn pieces were found inside a truck carrying scrap materials outside of your facility y . Destruction of this document was in deviation of your procedure Document To . of CQA 002 Killed Document Control Revision L Effective date 09 Rep 2022 Section 5 . 3 . 2 Document Destruction Process . 3 . Documents used to record raw data are not controlled . In January 23 2023 stacks of form 03 01 05 Course to Employee Training Foster and Exhibit of of CQA 024 . 03 Worker Training Questionnaire were observed in a cabinet in the room used to qualify visual inspector . They were identified as records . There is no process to reconcile how many are printed used and submitted as records . There are approximately 69 exhibits from site or procedures that are used for recording data that can be printed by any employee or filled out in Team Enter Unified using a word format . In additional 28 global quality forms used for recording data are maintained on a computer system available to all employees for printing . ,The batch production and control records are deficient in that they do not include in process control results . 1 . Original data is not being maintained and reviewed . The visual inspection machine has the capability to save electronic data or generate but neither was utilized . Only during qualification data was saved electronic call but not reviewed . Therefore quality personnel did not identify reported data . In But y 5 2022 a challenge identified as test was intended to be the first challenge of bad vilas as part of protocol 159 . After inspecting vilas it was found three of the camera on the visual inspection machine were not sanctioning . There was no investigation initiate d to determine the cause and assess whether it could have impacted other patches . The origin al data was not reported and no explanation was document . 2 . Data integrity assessment for production qui pent have not evacuated which equipment generate and maintains electronic data or that need to be retained and reviewed . ,Laboratory controls do not include the establishment of soon d and appropriate test procedures designed to assure that drug products conform to appropriate standards of identity strength quality and purity . 1 . Your firm has not established any written procedure pertaining to Analytical Method Salivation and Method Purification . Your firm has relied upon on your Analytical Development Laboratory R D Knit for and Method Purification activities . Your Quality Knit of and of has no oversight on the and Method Purification conducted at your R D Knit to determine the adequate of analytical test method according to cGMP regulations for testing of drug products sold to the market . The and method purification protocol and reports were signed and dated under Prepared By Reviewed By and Approved By sections by your R D Knit that is a separate entity located about 15 km from your site and it is no t registered with the . Your R D Knit provides and Method Purification support to additional sites of Baxter and about sites for Baxter . Your Senior Specialist of the site Quality Knit a nd Senior Manager of R D stated that R D Knit has never been internally a united by any of the Baxter sites . From April 2022 to 19 An 2023 your firm performed thirty five 35 and ten 10 analytical method purification at R D and has routed back two 2 analytical methods though CAPAs for root cause analysis and method improvement leading to retaliation because of investigations . The details are as follows a . Product Injection of of 2309629 Late opened 25 An 2022 of of 2249526 of of 2190369 b . Product Injection of of of 2298423 Late opened 05 An 2022 of of 2236278 of of 2103182 2 . Your firm has no written procedure established for Analytical Method Transfer . The analytical methods transferred to your site from R D is inadequate as it does not ensure the suitability of analytical method to perform the respective analysis of drug product . For example Your firm transferred analytical method from R D Knit to your site of based on system suitability and intermediate precision variation parameter as an acceptance criterion only for all products sold into the market . 3 . Your Saw Material Standard West Procedures s pertaining to Identification by are deficient in that there is no mention of background check using instrument method to be used for analysis que entity and procedure to prepare sample and standard disc . For example Your Saw material Document To . of of c 100001511 Tilted Effective date 02 War 2020 refers to Take the spectrum of the sample as well as working standard using the . Examine the substance prepared as The following issues were observed Your Document To . of 034 established s acceptance criterion as a correlation of standard and sample specters at However your of Laboratory provided no scientific justification for establishing limit for analysis . Is such the overlay of standard and sample spectrum for dated 19 Act 2022 was not identical and has areas with spikes . Your firm did not investigate the issues pertaining to amiability in the spectrum . The procedure explained by your of Nays t included running a background scan using and compare the blank spectrum with representative spectrum included in the respective . However there was no rear spectrum included in the and as such there is no mention of and running a background scan using it . There is no assurance over the consistency in sample and standard preparation since there is no mention of the quantity of test sample and standard to be used for preparing a separate disc with in your above reference . Your of Analyst stated that there is no exact quantity just use small amount of sample and standard to prepare discs with whereas your of Supervisor referred to the ratio of for sample standard and However your Document To . of 034 Killed Courier Transformed Revision D refers to sample to of quantity . There is no mention of the instrument method to be used for scanning the sample and standard . There is no mention of a technique that is used for preparing sample and standard disc with ,
