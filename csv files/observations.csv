The lower yield was found to be a result of increased rejection rates forglass pa1ti les during visual inspection including a 6 reject rate for batch bfC1 and a lbH4 reject rate for batch bT 4 Your nm s investigatio n infen ed that the most probable root cause is glass vial lot to lot variation . CAP A PR 624883 was opened in response to this deviation investigation .

On 04 Dec 2023 I observed a hole and rough around the b located inside the body of lb 4 ID GPN EQ 285 . I also observed light yellowish color sealant that was used to cover gaps sunounding the lb 4 was missing sealant and small pieces oflb 4 on the hole . There is a potential for these missing pieces may have mixed into the products manufactured using this non dedicated l6Jl4 . Fmther there is a potential for the deposition of powde1y materials to get accumulated  t urer OSD inside the holes and rough smfaces which may not get removed dming the manual Type B product changeover cleaning of this equipment . According to yom procedme SOP No . SOP009109 Version No . 10 . 0 there is no swab sample collected and tested for chemical and microbial testing from these areas oflb 4 ID GPN EQ 285 . QUALITY UNIT ,The responsibilities and procedures applicable to the quality control unit are not in writing and fully followed . Specifica lly A There is a lack of Quality Unit oversight on the issuance handling retrieval and reconciliation of GMP documents that are used in the manufactur ing of diug products at your site . This lack of oversight violates the film s QA SOP 018075 for GMP form issuance . For example 1 Controlled documents related to the following departmen ts can be printed from the Electronic Document Management System EDMS without any oversight of the Quality Unit . These documents are used to record original GMP info1mation . For example but not limited to QC forms such as Fo1m 060789 Request Fo1m for Re proces sing Fo1m 039593 Dissolution analysis checklist Fo1m 011918 Auto sampler validation record for model EDT 08LX Fo1m 034262 HPLC Chromatogram Checklist Fo1m 011907 U .

In addition the Quality Unit has given an access to employees across the site to all documents on EDMS which allows employees of other departments to print controlled documents unrelated to their respective departme nt . 2 During the inspection I observed the Quality Unit of your fnm allowed destruction of original GMP documents such as balance weight printouts conti olled fo1ms fo1mats . For example On 04 Dec 2023 I observed a balance printout pe1iaining to Balance ID GPN IN 545 Dated Timed 01 Dec 2023 b l4 Weight 8 . 007 g that was disposed inside your fnm s main scrapyard . The Production Technician that disposed this printout stated the practice of disposing the balance printout is n01mal by all employees in his depaiiment in the event ofprinting and weighing enors . The fnm only began recording the justification and type of document that was placed into the disposal bins less than one month ago on 06 Nov 2023 . However reconciliation of the documents disposed of on 11 Nov 2023 as noted in the logbook revealed the number of pages disposed inside the bin were less than the total number ofpages ofthe conti olled fo1ms . For example the entiy made in the logbook dated 11 Nov 2023 for the disposal of Cleaning Checklist Fo1m 037989TP 59 and Fo1m 037989TP 60 were  t urer OSD two separate entries pe1iaining to nine 9 pages fonns . However the number of pages received for disposal were eight 8 for Fo1m 037989TP 59 and two 2 for Fo1m 037989TP 60 . Your Quality Unit provided no justification for the missing one 1 page for Fo1m 037989TP 59 and six 6 pages for Fo1m 037989TP 60 . The total of eight 8 pages remained missing for which your fom conducted no investigation to ensure the missing pages does not get misused in the lack of Quality Unit s oversight on the issuance retrieval and reconciliation of GMP documents . B Your QC Microbiology laborato1y has no equipment usage logbook or any other document that 4records incubator usage details for a total l b Iincubators across various temperature ranges that are used to incubate microbial and environment monitoring plates . The lack of an issued logbook violates your SOP No . SOP008866 Titled Issuance Handling and Retrieval of Logbook Bounded Book Version No . 8 . 0 Section 5 . 0 and SOP No . SOP009405 Titled Instrument usage log Version No . 3 . 0 Section 5 . 0 . As a result of no equipment usage logbook or documentation for the incubators there is no assurance over its usage breakdown if any and whether calibrations were perfo1med on time . Per the above 4referenced procedures the Quality Unit of the fom is required to verify logbook enti ies b for usage and accuracy of data entered . However given the lack of logbooks this verification is not happening and there was no justification provided by your Microbiology management about not conducting these activities . ,Procedures describing the handling of written and oral complaints related to diug products are deficiently written or followed . Specifically your Quality Unit has failed to investigate Product Quality Complaints PQCs thoroughly . For example t urer OSD 4A . Your fnm restricted PQC s trend evaluation for a period of b only while you marketed diug products into the US with a shelf life of over b . J for which you received many market complaints post b 4 period . For example Count variability market complaints PQCs in b . J Batch No .

As a result of limited historical trend . . _ev_a . . _1 ua t . io_n_o f PQCs your fnm s complaint investigations are incomplete and not thoroughly investigated to dete1mine the root cause and to take appropriate market actions such as filing a Field Alert and potentially recalling batch es . B . Your fnm has not thorou . ghly inv stigatel count variability market complaints for lb i4l tt 4 Tablets i mg and tt 4 diug products . On 11 Dec 2023 I observed your fnm received mainly between 7 to 22 comp amts each month since year 2019 to 01 Dec 2023 for count variability complaints . The evaluation of randomly selected twelve 12 PQCs for the period of year 2021 to 01 Dec 2023revealed that the complaints were closed based on the similar investigation  t urer OSD summa1y root cause and CAPAs repetitively simply by rewriting these sections or copy and pasting upon changing the batch info1mation . Your fnm took no meaningful effo1ts to dete1mine the root cause and establish CAP As to overcome the count variability PQCs . C . The fnm does not provide procedures or guidance to the contracted third paity PQC call center that receives incoming product quality complaints so product specific questions can be asked to the complainants during follow up attempts to get a meaningful info1mation that would be significant to dete1mine the root cause . ,An tt ll4 Field Alert Repo1t was not subinitted within three working days of receipt of info1mation concerning significant chemical physical or other change or deterioration in a distributed dmg product . Specifically Your fnm failed to submit a Field Ale1t for Product Quality Complaints PQCs . For example A . In the period of Januaiy 2019 to 01 Dec 2023 your fnm received 468 complaints out of 1355 complaints relating to count variability sho1t and excess count issues globally of which ai ound 457 complaints out of 1209 complaints were repo1ted from the US market .

Your fom categorized these complaints as Minor without conducting any Health Hazard Evaluation HHE . About 95 of these complaints were substantiated confomed valid upon investigation and some through verification of controlled samples by your Quality Unit . However there was no Field Ale1t filed by your fom to the agency . This is in deviation of your SOP No . SOP008879 Titled Field Alert Repo1t FAR Management and Process Version 3 . 0 Effective date 29 Dec 2020 .

Your fnm did not thoroughly investigate the PQCs related to lack of efficacy complaint when the product details including batch number was provided by the complainant . For example 4 4 Your fnm received multiple PQC related to lack of efficacy for fb ITablets USA b 7 fb 4 7 process validation batches from the US market lb l4 Tablets mg USA Batch Number b 4 Total complaints 10 Tabletsi mg USA Batch Number b 4 TabletsJ mg USA Batch Number b 4 Tabletstl mg USA Batch Number fb 4 Total complaints 12 Total complaints 11 Total complaints 5 fu each of these PQCs your fnm simply relied upon stability study timepoint data while the repetitive complaints were being filed and conducted no controlled samples physical evaluation and testing for any of the above stated batches . Your fnm did not conduct Health Hazard Evaluatio n HHE and there were no Field Ale1is filed to the agency . 4Your fnm concluded the above PQCs pe1iaining to four 4 different batches offb I Tablets simply by rewriting the similar info1mation in the sections of investigatio n summa1y root cause CAPA etc . These practices of simply rewriting the investigatio n has resulted in no meaningful investigatio n as the repetitive PQCs were being repo1ied to the firm for the lack of efficacy . and b 4 3 .

Specifica lly A Each lot of Controlled Reserve Retain samples of di11g products is not examined at least once a 4year for the evidence of deterioration and physical defects . Your fnm s rationale based on b for the selection of limited number ofbatches is not justifiable while there are significant gaps identified in your film s Quality and Production Systems along with several repeated product quality complaints pertaining to count variability broken half tablets and lack of efficacy .

Your mvestlgat10 n m1batea on September 26 2023 dete1m ined the source of the en do toxin was atb ibuted to the I CbT 1 API used to manufacture these batches . The investigation at the API manufacturer did not identify a definitive root cause but dete1min d the probable cause of the OOS was operatin rson might have missed to a ee Y_ the I CbT i to release the I present inside t ie I I and this 4might have resulted in hold up of I CbH in I Cb C4l in the stated batches . 4Considering the scope of proliferation on storage and stagnat10n of bY in any given system there is a scope for the microbial proliferatio n which in tum might have probably contributed for the development of endotoxins in the I Cbn 4lwhich would have fo1warded with the fmther manufacturing process pe1taining to subject batches . This probable cause was not confnm ed to be the source of endotoxin and this robable cause is also not limited specifically to the I CbTC 4lAPI batches I t ff1 used to manufacture the OOS fmished product batches . Fmtheimore on December 2 2023 your raw material testing for I bTC API confnmed three batches tested positive for endotoxin .

OOS PR ID 2300482 Product Injection USP mg Batch Number Result Individual unknown impurity at RT Limit NMT Final OOS classification Invalid OOS  Date OOS Investigation Logged 10 Jan 2022 Date OOS Investigation Closed 23 Feb 2022 Root cause functioning of the HPLC On January 10 2022 your QC laboratory obtained failing result for individual unknown impurity at RT which you confirmed through hypothesis test on the original HPLC ID EQP QC 418 and ruled out any issue with HPLC instrument analyst and retention times theoretical plates and tailing factor . Your QC laboratory changed HPLC systems without any scientific justification to repeat the analysis using freshly prepared mobile phase standard and sample test solutions . Your firm attempted to co mplete repeat analysis on different HPLC systems for multiples days however the repeat an alysis was aborted at the system suitability stage due to incidents as mentioned below HPLC ID EQP QC 304 Dated analysis initiated 25 Jan 2022 Incident peak not eluted missing in standard HPLC ID EQP QC 308 Dated analysis initiated 31 Jan 2022 Incident Improper peak shape of peak In the above two 2 cases your firm deviated from SOP Document No . CF QCD 002 Revision C Titled Handling of Laboratory Incidences . Your firm did not log the incident to investigate the issues pertaining to missing peak and for improper peak shape of peak . The overall assessment of OOS logged for the US market in years 2021 and 2022 revealed three 3 out of fifty two 52 OOS having laboratory incidents during OOS investigation . However your firm did not log a separate LIR to investig ate the root cause . Furthermore in the same period of years 2021 and 2022 your firm changed the HPLC instrument in seven 7 OOS investigations without any scientific justificat ion and invalidated the original failing results  through repeat analysis . 5 . No further CAPA actions are initiated when there are repeated Laboratory Incidence Reports LIR s that identify the same root cause unless there are associated with the same analyst in a For example there were 10 LIR s in 2022 that id entified pipetting errors during BET analyses but no further action was identified in the LIR investigations . Additionally in communications with the FDA in October 2022 your site stated there were No OOS due to Pipetting error post implementation of CAPA Jan 2022 as it related to a review of BET testing . This response did not consider the continuing LIR s that were opened f or pipetting errors during BET testing . The response to the FDA also provided a graph demonstrating decreasing BET OOS investigations with the statement the site has implemented significant enhancements related to BET testing by KTA . As a result the site has consistently reduced the number of OOS BET results for the KTA method from 66 in 2017 to two through October 2022 and none since April 2022 . However since November 2020 investigations that we re previously classified as OOS were instead identified as LIR . The LIR data from 2021 and 2022 was not considered in this trend analysis . 6 . On October 25 2022 FDA communicated to your firm that the identified root cause for OOS investigations 2345266 and 2349143 for BET were not scientifically based . The investigations have not been further evaluated since that time . 7 . Since July of 2022 there have been 16 LIRs opened for cracked desiccated media observed at the end of sample collection or during plate reading . A comprehensive investigation of media handling at this site was not conducted . An investigation provided by the media supplier on December 1 2022 identified that the root cause may be due to the type of used and that the supplier would switch to providing an with a low No action was taken for the existing supplies of still in invent ory prior to this change by the supplier . ,Equipment and utensils are not cleaned and maintained at appropriate intervals to prevent contamination that would alter the safety identity strength quality or purity of the drug product . 1 . We observed change parts for the filling and capping lines were damaged in ways that may generate particulate or make them difficult to clean . Change parts were observed encrusted with black brown and color materials . The details are included as follows a . on Filling Machine This change part is installed on filling line .

Filling machine This change part is installed on the filling line . It was observed to have chips and a rough surface . Areas on the had an unknown sticky substance .  2 . We observed defects on your line filling machine EQP PRD 57 while it was tagged in CLEANED status on January 26 2023 . This is a non dedicated filling line and it is used the manufacturing and filling of Injection USP mg ml ml glass vials for the USA market . The details are as follows a . sheet below the plate was found damaged and missing piece of sheet . Additionally the sheet was observed cracked and with black color spots across multiple areas . b . below filling station White color powder stains indicative of leakage from the pipe due to spillage . c . The color coating on the base of this equipment was peeling off in many parts along with scratch marks and improper closure at the point of sheet . d . we observed scratch and sign of color material deposition . Upon wiping the area of the we observed color spots on the white wipes . e . Bulk solution holding tank ID EQP PRD 06 Lit . We observed white color spots at the bottom of the tank in the product contact areas after the tank had been cleaned . 3 . We observed defects on your Filling machine EQP PRD 117 while it was tagged in CLEANED status on January 26 2023 . This is a non dedicated filling line and it is used the manufacturing and filling of following products for the USA market Injection USP  mg ml ml and ml Injection USP mg ml ml Injection USP mg ml ml Injection USP mg ml ml a . Black color spots on and b . Scratches on the machine back side of filling machine 4 . The located directly above the open vials at the for the filling line uses a threaded bolt that is moved and tightened along the On January 19 2023 it was observed that this activity appeared to create wear on the creating a rough surface and potential particulate . 5 . On January 19 2023 gaps were observed between th e laminar air flow units and the wall where vials exit the on the filling line . 6 . On December 14 2022 during an IPQA evaluation of the filling line the IPQA identified inadequate sealing damage at the door for LAF guard on right side of the line . Service request 42676 was created on December 16 2022 . As of January 19 2023 no work order had been created to address the unsealed areas on the line . ,Written procedures are not established for the cl eaning and maintenance of equipment including utensils used in the manufacture processing packing or holding of a drug product . 1 . The procedure B1 PRD 018 for the filling line has no instructions for cleaning the change parts that are removed from the filling line . These non dedicated parts are changed for different vial sizes but after remov al from the line they are put in a storage cupboard without any cleaning . The parts are wiped with during the transfer back into the filling area and wipe with after installation . On January 26 2023 when these parts were taken out of the cupboard they were found to have unidentified materials on them and some parts had an unknown sticky residue . 2 . The procedure B1 PRD 025 for the line ha s no detailed instruction for cleaning change parts of different sizes shapes and surfac e materials to completely remove any potential contaminants . Operators reported they wipe with and do the cleaning inside of the filling room . There is no cleaning verification to ensu re this process is ad equate and on January 26 2023 cleaned change pa rts were observed encrusted in places with unknown black and color materials . 3 . Point 1 of your line clearance checklist states Check all th e change part for correct format size and ensure no damage . Your production operators select Not damaged option even though change parts were found damaged when inspected on January 26 2023 . ,Equipment used in the manufacture processing packing or holding of drug products is not of appropriate design to facilitate operations for its intended use and cleaning and maintenance . 1 . The filling rooms and capping rooms for both the and filling lines used for US market product are not designed to permit operator s to move freely to the required areas . Manufacturing operators are required to go underneath the line to get back and forth to the different sides of the machine to perform rout ine interventions during filling such as adding stoppers to the stopper bowl . 2 . After vial washing on the line vials move via conveyor to the The barrier installed to protect the vials as they move on the conveyor has gaps exposing the vials to the Grade D environment after vial washing . 3 . The filling line is not designed to permit viewing from windows or cameras from outside of the aseptic gowning areas . Entry reco rds show QA is not providing routine oversight during filling operations . 4 . There is a drain line below the filling stati on on the line to capture spilled product or product from broken vials . This drain line has not been designed to facilitate cleaning . ,Your firm failed to establish adequate written pr ocedures for production and process controls designed to assure that the drug products have the identity strength purity and quality that they are purported or represented to possess . 1 . During the manual visual inspection of ml batch and ml batch on January 20 2023 as well as visual inspection of ml batch and ml batch on January 23 2023 there were visual inspectors that did not follow procedure B1 PRD 064 Manual Visual Inspection of Filled Products . These visual inspectors did not inspect against for a minimum of 2 . Review of completed visual inspection records found B1 P RD 064 Manual Visual Inspection of Filled Products could not have been followed because more units were inspected in the documented time periods than would have been reasonably possible if the procedure had been followed . a . On September 23 2022 during visual inspection of batch the inspectors averaged an overall speed of per bag . The procedure requires at least to inspect the at least to inspect on Additionally time is needed to pick up and put down bags and physically remove and categorize defective bags . b . On December 10 2022 during manual visual inspection of of Injection USP mg ml ml the inspectors averaged per vials . For inspection of vials the procedure first requires inspection of the caps and batch printed data a step observed to take when viewed on January 23 2023 . This is followed by a minimum inspection time of Additionally time is needed to pick up or put down vials physically place defects into bins or move the inspected outside of the visual inspection room . 3 . There is a lack of scientific rationale for elimin ating vials containing particles of known sizes from the kits used to qualify the manual visual inspectors . is used in the manufacturing area and there was apparent wear on observed directly above open vials on the filling line . During the initial qualification of the defect kit defects were detected at a lower rate than other particle types . 4 . There is a lack of scientific rationale for estab lishing the acceptance criteria for manual visual inspectors of not less than by combining type A defects including particulates and type B defects including empty vials and wrong color . Further change control 2531727 has approved changing the acceptance criteria for vials with particulates to at least without a scientific rationale for how this limit was chosen . The ranging study for the known particle defects showed a probability of detection at or above for all particles down to μm for glass particles stopper particles fibers and hairs . The manual inspector qualification test kits contain these  types of defects at μm of greater size . 5 . The acceptance criteria for light intensity during visual inspection was changed from to not less than lux for all products on Oct ober 5 2019 but lacked a rationale for why the change was made . This limit applies to vials in clear vials and amber vials inspected for the US market . There was no evaluation of whether amber vi als require higher light intensity or whether the clear vials should have an upper limit . On January 23 2023 measurements in the visual inspection area for EQP PRD 443 showed variation within the area . Booth had a reading of lux taken at the while booth had a reading of lux taken from the On that day ml batch was being visually inspected which is a clear liquid inside of a clear vial . Amber vials are also visually in spected using the same visual inspection booths . ,Procedures designed to prevent microbiological contamination of drug products purporting to be sterile are not established . 1 . For Injection USP mg ml ml the bulk bioburden sample is collected from the manufacturing tank . The product is subsequently transferred to the holding tank through a There is no established hold time limit the product can remain in the holding tank before is started . For example during batch the time between bioburden sampling and the end of was approximately 11 hour ere is no bioburden sampling data from the holding tank . The product is transferred through a prior to filling and the bioburden is tested using filled vials . 2 . An operator working in the filling room of the line on January 19 2023 during the filling of batch was obs erved with exposed skin on their forehead . ,Procedures for the preparation of master production and control records are not followed . Your Quality Unit lacks adequate oversight on th e control and management of GMP documents . For example 1 . On 19 Jan 2023 we found torn pieces of analytica l balance weight printout in a transparent plastic scrap bag located inside your QC Laboratory . The torn pieces were pertaining to Balance ID EQP QC 503 balance printout dated 18 Jan 2023 and belonged to test sample of mg ml Batch Number Test Assay and Weight ml . Your QC Analyst stated the weight printout was destroyed due to the sample preparation issue . Your QC Analyst deviated from the following procedures due to destruction of balance printout Original Raw Data x Document No . CF CQA 002 Titled Document Control Revision L Effective date 09 Sep 2022 Section 5 . 3 . 2 Document Destruction Process x Document Number CF CQA 003 Titled Good Documentation Practices Revision E Effective date 05 Jan 2023 x Document Number GQP 04 04 Titled Data Integrity Revision C Effective date 29 Jul 2021 Furthermore the sample weighing and analytical balance printout destruction activities occurred during the that has no Supervisory oversight . 2 . On 19 Jan 2023 we observed your production uni t employees destroyed GMP documents signed under Done By section by tearing into pi eces . These torn pieces were found inside a truck carrying scrap materials outside of your facilit y . Destruction of this document was in deviation of your procedure Document No . CF CQA 002 Titled Document Control Revision L Effective date 09 Sep 2022 Section 5 . 3 . 2 Document Destruction Process . 3 . Documents used to record raw GMP data are not controlled . On January 23 2023 stacks of form GQF 03 01 05 Course to Employee Training Roster and Exhibit EX CF CQA 024 . 03 Worker Training Questionnaire were observed in a cabinet in the room used to qualify visual inspectors . They were identified as GMP records . There is no process to reconcile how many are printed used and submitted as GMP records . There are approximately 69 exhibits from site pr ocedures that are used for recording GMP data that can be printed by any employee or filled out in Team Center Unified using a Microsoft word format . An additional 28 global quality forms used for recording GMP data are maintained on a computer system available to all employees for printing . ,The batch production and control records are deficient in that they do not include in process control results . 1 . Original data is not being maintained and reviewed . The visual inspection machine has the capability to save electronic data or generate printouts but neither was utilized . Only during qualification data was saved electroni cally but not reviewed . Therefore quality personnel did not identify unreported data . On Jul y 5 2022 a challenge identified as test1 was intended to be the first challenge of bad vials as part of protocol MIS BA1 159 . After inspecting vials it was found three of the cameras on the visual inspection machine were not functioning . There was no investigation initiate d to determine the cause and assess whether it could have impacted other batches . The origin al data was not reported and no explanation was documented . 2 . Data integrity assessments for production equi pment have not evaluated which equipment generates and maintains electronic data or printouts that need to be retained and reviewed . ,Laboratory controls do not include the establishment of scientifically soun d and appropriate test procedures designed to assure that drug products conform to appropriate standards of identity strength quality and purity . 1 . Your firm has not established any written procedure pertaining to Analytical Method Validation AMV and Method Verification . Your firm has relied upon on your ADL Analytical Development Laboratory R D Unit for AMV and Method Verification activities . Your Quality Unit QA and QC has no oversight on the AMV and Method Verification conducted at your ADL R D Unit to determine the adequacy of analytical test method according to cGMP regulations for testing of drug products sold to the USA market . The AMV and method verification protocols and reports were signed and dated under Prepared By Reviewed By and Approved By sections by your ADL R D Unit that is a separate entity located about 15 km from your site and it is no t registered with the USFDA . Your ADL R D Unit provides AMV and Method Verification support to additional sites of Baxter Pharmaceuticals and about CMO sites for Baxter Pharmaceuticals . Your Senior Specialist of the site Quality Unit a nd Senior Manager of ADL R D stated that ADL R D Unit has never been internally a udited by any of the Baxter sites . From April 2022 to 19 Jan 2023 your firm performed thirty five 35 AMV and ten 10 analytical method verification at ADL R D and has routed back two 2 analytical methods though CAPAs for root cause analysis and method improvement leading to revalidation because of OOS investigations . The details are as follows a . Product Injection USP CAPA PR ID 2309629 Date opened 25 Jan 2022 NCR PR ID 2249526 OOS PR ID 2190369 b . Product Injection BP CAPA PR ID 2298423 Date opened 05 Jan 2022 NCR PR ID 2236278 OOS PR ID 2103182 2 . Your firm has no written procedure established for Analytical Method Transfer AMT . The analytical methods transferred to your site from ADL R D is inadequate as it does not ensure the suitability of analytical method to perform the respective analysis of drug product . For example Your firm transferred analytical method from ADL R D Unit to your site QC based on system suitability and intermediate precision validation parameter as an acceptance criterion only for all products sold into the USA market . 3 . Your Raw Material Standard Test Procedures STP s pertaining to Identification by FTIR are deficient in that there is no mention of background check using instrument method to be used for analysis qua ntity and procedure to prepare sample and standard disc . For example Your Raw material STP Document No . RT QC 91c 100001511 Tilted USP Effective date 02 Mar 2020 refers to Take the Infrared spectrum of the sample as well as working standard using the FTIR Spectrophotometer . Examine the substance prepared as  The following issues were observed Your SOP Document No . CF QCD 034 establishe s acceptance criteria as a correlation of standard and sample spectra at NLT However your QC Laboratory provided no scientific justification for establishing NLT limit for FTIR analysis . As such the overlay of standard and sample spectrums for USP dated 19 Oct 2022 was not identical and has areas with spikes . Your firm did not investigate the issues pertaining to variability in the FTIR spectrum . The procedure explained by your QC Analys t included running a background scan using and compare the blank spectrum with representative spectrum included in the respective STP . However there was no repr esentative spectrum included in the STP and as such there is no mention of and running a background scan using it . There is no assurance over the consistency in sample and standard preparation since there is no mention of the quantity of test sample and standard to be used for preparing a separate disc with in your above referenced STP . Your QC Analyst stated that there is no exact quantity just use small amount of sample and standard to prepare discs with whereas your QC Supervisor referred to the ratio of for sample standard and However your SOP Document No . CF QCD 034 Titled Fourier Transformed Infrared Spectrometer FTIR Revision D refers to sample to of quantity . There is no mention of the instrument method to be used for scanning the sample and standard . There is no mention of a technique that is used for preparing sample and standard disc with  DATES OF INSPECTION 1 19 2023 Thu 1 20 2023 Fri 1 23 2023 Mon 1 24 2023 Tue 1 25 2023 Wed 1 26 2023 Thu 1 27 2023 Fri Pratik S Upadhyay Investigator Dedicated Drug CadreSigned By Pratik S .
